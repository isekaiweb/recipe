            We understand that there's no short supply of carrot cake recipes in the universe, but ours is‚Äîquite simply‚Äîthe best. It comes from our Deputy Editor's great-grandma and there's just no arguing with that. It will be the shining star among all your Easter Desserts this year. 

            Why vegetable oil?

            It's all about moisture, people! Cakes using vegetable are often noticeably more moist than cakes using butter. Why is this? Consider the whole ingredient: vegetable oil is liquid at room temperature, while butter solidifies. 

            Another case for veggie oil over butter? Tenderness. Butter has some percentage of water content (usually 15-20%). When that liquid is mixed with flour, gluten forms more rapidly. (We learned all about this when researching our sourdough recipe!) Vegetable oil, on the other hand, is 100% fat, meaning less gluten formation and ultimately, more tender cake.

            It also makes prep easier‚Äîno need to let butter soften or need to cream it with sugar. We love a good shortcut!

            Can I make it without raisins? Or pecans?

            You sure can! If you're not a fan of raisins, try dried cranberries or other dried fruit instead. If you'd like to try a larger dried fruit like apricots or figs, we'd suggest chopping them into raisin-sized pieces. You can also leave the dried fruit out all together. 

            We love the added crunch and flavor of pecans, but any nut would be great in this cake. Walnuts, cashews, or even pistachios would be delicious additions.

            Can I add pineapple?

            Classic old-fashioned carrots cake often include pineapple. While ours doesn't include any, this recipe works well with it. Add about 1/2 cup of chopped pineapple (drained if from a can!) when you add the carrots, raisins, and pecans. 

            Can I make this ahead of time?

            Absolutely. After baking, let them cool completely, then wrap each layer individually with plastic wrap and refrigerate. They should last for up to a week! Layers can also be doubled wrapped and place in the freezer for a few months. You can frost from frozen and then let thaw for easy frosting! 

            You can also shred your carrots ahead of time to make the assembly of the cake super quick. They'll last in the fridge for a few days. 

            We don't typically recommend making the frosting too far in advance as it is easier to use right after making it. If you want to make it ahead of time we would recommend refrigerating it and then letting it come to room temperature before attempting to frost your cake. Stir it every so often to help speed this along or put it in a bowl and beat with a hand mixer to help soften it.

                    1. Preheat oven to 350¬∞. Season lamb shanks with salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, heat oil. Add lamb and cook until golden all over, about 4 minutes per side. Work in batches as necessary. Remove lamb from pot and place on a plate.
                     
                    2. In the pot, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add onion and carrots and cook until soft, 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more, then add tomato paste and stir until vegetables are coated.
                     
                    3. Pour in broth and tomato sauce, then return lamb shanks to pot. Add rosemary and bring to a boil. Cover and transfer to oven. Cook until lamb shanks are completely tender, 2 hours.
                    
                    4. Remove lamb from pot and place on a cutting board. Tent with foil to keep warm. Discard rosemary.
                     
                    5. Return pot to stove over medium heat. Add wine and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and let simmer until thickened, 10 minutes. Stir in remaining 2 tablespoons butter.
                     
                    6. Serve lamb with mashed potatoes and spoon sauce on top.
